**Saying hello**
 I'm on the `freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ IRC network Monday
 through Friday, from around 9am EST through 5pm EST.

Issue a ``/who tbielawa*`` command to the server, a handle with the
netmask ``~tbielawa@redhat/tbielawa`` will appear for you to
``/query`` if I'm online.

**E-Mail**
 If you want to contact me directly, clone the project and look at any
 of `my bitmath commits

 to find my email address.

 time to time.
