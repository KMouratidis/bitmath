%description
bitmath simplifies many facets of interacting with file sizes in
various units. Examples include: converting between SI and NIST prefix
units (GiB to kB), converting between units of the same type (SI to
SI, or NIST to NIST), basic arithmetic operations (subtracting 42KiB
from 50GiB), and rich comparison operations (1024 Bytes == 1KiB).

In addition to the conversion and math operations, bitmath provides
human readable representations of values which are suitable for use in
interactive shells as well as larger scripts and applications.
