class BitmathType(click.ParamType):
    """An parameter type for integrations with the click module.

and https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/options/#basic-value-options

Example usage of the click Bitmath type for a click argument:

  from bitmath.integrations.bmclick import BitmathType

  @click.command()
  @click.argument('size', type=BitmathType)
  def best_prefix(size):
      click.echo(size.best_prefix())

It can also be used for click options:

  from bitmath.integrations.bmclick import BitmathType

  @click.command()
  @click.option('--size', required=True, type=BitmathType)
  def best_prefix(size):
      click.echo(size.best_prefix())
"""
    name = 'bitmath'

    def convert(self, value, param, ctx):
        try:
            return bitmath.parse_string(value)
        except ValueError:
            self.fail("'%s' can not be parsed into a valid bitmath object" %
                      value)
